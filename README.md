# WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate-Maker
A command line tool to rename "plugin-name" in  DevinVinson/WordPress-Plugin-Boilerplate to your own plugin name.
I really hated how the "generators" also renamed properties and methods containing 'plugin_name', so I made my own.
One thing it doesn't do is adding an authur name or e-mail; I like to force myself to go in and edit the file fully.
